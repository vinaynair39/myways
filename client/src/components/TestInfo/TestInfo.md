# TestInfo

when the user clicks on a certain test from the dashboard, A new page is rendered which gives a short description of the test that the user is about to take. Here the information is coming from a json(via backend) and it contains all the necessary information along with the questions and options of that test

when the user clicks the start button, the user is redirected to a new page (TestPage.jsx) where we determine if the test the user is about to take is of TypeA or TypeB. (check TESTA and TESTB component for more info)
